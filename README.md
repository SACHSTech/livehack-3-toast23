# ICS2O1 LiveHack 3

## Instructions
For each of the described problems:
* Write a python solution to the problem in the appropriate file
* Use proper variable naming and whitespacing
* Use appropriate commenting and include a program header
* Make input and output user friendly



### Running your code
You can enter the following in the terminal to run your code:  
`python3 problem1.py`  
`python3 problem2.py`

## Problem 1 - For Loop
Each player in a tournament plays six games. There are no ties. The tournament director places the players in groups based on the results of games as follows:

* if a player wins 5 or 6 games, they are placed in Group 1;
* if a player wins 3 or 4 games, they are placed in Group 2;
* if a player wins 1 or 2 games, they are placed in Group 3;
* if a player does not win any games, they are eliminated from the tournament.  

Write a program to determine which group a player is placed in.

#### Sample Run 1
```
******  Tournament Tracker ******

Enter the wins and losses for your team:
W
L
W
W
L
W
Your team is in Group 2
```

#### Sample Run 2
```
******  Tournament Tracker ******

Enter the wins and losses for your team:
L
L
L

L
L
Your team is eliminated from the tournament
```




## Problem 2 - While Loop
Tony is a new DoorDash Driver and is tracking statistics for the first 100km that he's driven for the food delivery service.  Write a program that allows Tony to enter the distance driven for each day until the total distance driven surpasses 100km.  The program will compute and output:
* the number of days it took to pass 100 km
* average distance driven per day. 

Round distances to the nearest kilometre.

#### Sample Run
```
 ***** Welcome to the DoorDash Distance Tracker ****** 

** Travel Log ** 
Enter the distance travelled for the day: 37
Enter the distance travelled for the day: 40
Enter the distance travelled for the day: 25

** Summary **
It took 3 days to surpass 100km driven.
The average distance driven per day is 34 km.
